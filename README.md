## Overview üìù

This notebook implements a cointegrated pairs trading strategy following the Algovibes tutorial "[Cointegrated Pairs Trading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUMW9LEv4Qw)". The strategy identifies pairs of assets that are cointegrated, meaning their prices move together in the long term despite short-term deviations, and trades based on the mean-reversion of their price relationship.

## Features ‚ú®

- Data retrieval using yfinance
- Testing for cointegration between asset pairs
- Calculation of hedge ratios using OLS regression
- Spread calculation and normalization
- Z-score based trading signal generation
- Strategy backtesting and visualization
- Performance metrics calculation

## Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- statsmodels
- matplotlib
- yfinance
- scipy
- Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook

## Installation üì¶

1. Open the Google Colab notebook:
   ```
   https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BfrSyR51RUWzw52CKddczraji-OkE2Cf
   ```

2. The notebook includes all necessary package installations.

## Implementation Steps ‚öôÔ∏è

The notebook follows these key steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Fetches historical price data for selected asset pairs using yfinance
2. **Cointegration Testing**: Tests if the selected pairs are cointegrated using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
3. **Spread Calculation**: Computes the spread between the pairs using the calculated hedge ratio
4. **Z-score Normalization**: Normalizes the spread using rolling mean and standard deviation
5. **Signal Generation**: Creates trading signals when z-scores cross predefined thresholds
6. **Backtesting**: Simulates trading based on the signals and calculates returns
7. **Performance Analysis**: Evaluates strategy performance using metrics like cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, and drawdowns

## Trading Logic üß†

- **Entry Signals**:
  - When z-score exceeds upper threshold: Short the spread (short asset 1, long asset 2)
  - When z-score falls below lower threshold: Long the spread (long asset 1, short asset 2)
- **Exit Signals**:
  - Exit positions when z-score reverts to mean (crosses zero or predefined exit thresholds)

## Visualisation üëÄ

The notebook creates various visualizations:
- Price movements of the cointegrated pairs
- Spread and z-score time series
- Trading signals overlaid on z-score
- Cumulative returns of the strategy
- Drawdown analysis

## Credits üôèüèª

This implementation is based on the tutorial by [Algovibes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUMW9LEv4Qw) on YouTube. Their excellent explanation of cointegrated pairs trading provided the foundation for this notebook.

## Further Improvements ‚ú®

Potential enhancements to the basic strategy:
- Implementation of stop-loss mechanisms
- Dynamic threshold calculation
- Portfolio of multiple cointegrated pairs
- Transaction cost modeling
- Alternative cointegration tests and hedge ratio calculations
